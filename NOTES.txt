== Inheritance hierarchy ==
EntityBase:
	Player
	EnemyBase:
		Chicken
	ItemBase:
		AngelsBlessing
		DemonsCurse
	WeaponBase:
		DDD

EntityBase is the base scene for all things that move
GameManager is for component composition and dependency injection

NO PROJECTILE SPEED - just inherit player's linear velocity

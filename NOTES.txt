== Inheritance hierarchy ==
EntityBase:
	Player
	EnemyBase:
		Chicken
	ItemBase:
		AngelsBlessing
		DemonsCurse
	WeaponBase:
		DDD

EntityBase is the base scene for all things that move
GameManager is for component composition and dependency injection

NO PROJECTILE SPEED - just inherit player's linear velocity

TODO:
- Implement (from design doc):
	- Enemies:
		- Goat (charge)
		- Cow (tank)
		- Ghost (circle-walk)
		- Demon (ranged scythe boomerang + fast-circling + if close enough; backing-off)
		- Cultist (healer + fast-backing-off)
	- Bosses:
		- Boris
		- Sharkteeth
		- Fish
		- Gunshot
		- Nerd
	- Add virtual "upgrade(multiplier)" to ItemBase & implement in subclasses
	- ^ then: Altar (item1 + item2 -> item1 values *= 2)
- (?)Make custom TileSet with:
	- Player
	- Enemies
	- Weapons
	- Items
- (?)Design map in draw.io:
	- Make starter room ("Move", "Attack", "Use Item", "Drop/Throw Item", "Restart")
	- Item rooms
	- Boss rooms
	- Final boss room
- Implement Map design (TileMap + enemies, weapons, & items):
	- MENTION PASSIVE & ACTIVE IN ITEM ROOMS
- Implement player power persistence (if player chooses loop):
	1) Move to parent node (GameManager)
	2) Reload Map scene
	3) Get transform of player in reloaded Map scene
	4) Delete player in Map scene
	5) Set obtained transform to moved player
	6) Move moved player into reloaded Map scene
- SFX (AudioStreamGenerator) (deep sine wave for railgun)
- Music (General is chiller, boss is more IMPACTFUL)

- AFTER RELEASE:
	- Try to fix Shooty Thingamabob not hitting freshly-enough activated enemies
	- REFACTOR GAME CODE:
		- Duplicated sibling code
		- Replace var's default const with default on var itself
		- Walrus operator

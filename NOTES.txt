== Inheritance hierarchy ==
EntityBase:
	Player
	EnemyBase:
		<ENEMIES>
	ItemBase:
		<ITEMS>
	WeaponBase:
		<WEAPONS>

EntityBase is the base scene for all things that move
GameManager is for component composition and dependency injection

NO PROJECTILE SPEED - just inherit player's linear velocity

TODO:
- Implement (from design doc):
	- Enemies:
		- Cultist (healer (<- +VFX) + backing-off)
			- ^ for VFX: 0.5->0.0 fading green circle
			- Either heal all while on screen, or heal area
	- Altar <- add virtual "upgrade(multiplier)" to ItemBase & implement in subclasses
		- ^ then VIA SIGNAL->GameManager: Altar (item1 + item2 -> item1 values *= 2)
	- Bosses:
		- Boris (1000 HP)
		- Fish (2000 HP)
		- Sharkteeth (5000 HP)
		- Gunshot (10000 HP)
		- Nerd (100000 HP)
- Make Map (TileMap + enemies, weapons, & items):
	- MENTION PASSIVE & ACTIVE IN ITEM ROOMS
- Implement player power persistence (if player chooses loop):
	1) Move to parent node (GameManager)
	2) Reload Map scene
	3) Get transform of player in reloaded Map scene
	4) Delete player in Map scene
	5) Set obtained transform to moved player
	6) Move moved player into reloaded Map scene
- SFX:
	- AudioStreamGenerator logn interp sine wave module
	- ^ + AudioStreamPlayer2D
	- ^ for railgun: scale sound length & depth based on damage
- Music (General is chiller, boss is more IMPACTFUL)


FOR V2.0 (after release):
	- REFACTOR GAME CODE:
		- Create modules:
			- LifeTimer (+ for CanvasItem in parent: modulate.a) (replace existing individual LifeTimer's)
			- Shake (replace ElectromagnetShake)
			- Bleed (replace AztecDeathWhistle's bleed)
			- Flash (replace AztecDeathWhistle's flash)
			- Shot (replace ElectromagnetBeam & ShootyThingamabobShot)
			- Projectile (replace DDD, CursedFish, & BottomlessChickenPouch projectile)
		- Duplicated sibling code
		- Collision layers
		- Instead of emitting attacked on holder, emit own signal and connect own emitted signal via GameManager to emit signal on holder - ...maybe also generalize holder...?
		- Parametrize sprite.modulate.a in DDD, CursedFish, & BottomlessChickenPouch pick_up override
		- ?ACTIVATED_ALPHA for ItemBase?
	- Map editor
	- Multiplayer?
	- Starting room:
		- "Solo" pad
		- "Multi" pad
		- "Edit" pad
		- "Exit" pad (ESC in-game goes to starting room)

== Inheritance hierarchy ==
EntityBase:
	Player
	EnemyBase:
		<ENEMIES>
	ItemBase:
		<ITEMS>
	WeaponBase:
		<WEAPONS>

EntityBase is the base scene for all things that move
GameManager is for component composition and dependency injection

NO PROJECTILE SPEED - just inherit player's linear velocity

TODO:
- Make Map (TileMap + enemies, weapons, & items):
	- MENTION PASSIVE & ACTIVE IN ITEM ROOMS
- SFX: AudioStreamPlayer2D
	- ^ for railgun: scale sound length & depth based on damage

- FINAL BOSS:
	- Nerd (100000 HP)
	- Touhou finger attacks
	- BANGER music
	- Sfx & Vfx
- Implement player power persistence (if player chooses loop):
	1) Move to parent node (GameManager)
	2) Reload Map scene
	3) Get transform of player in reloaded Map scene
	4) Delete player in Map scene
	5) Set obtained transform to moved player
	6) Move moved player into reloaded Map scene

Quit; lost motivation, burnt out

2D physics soulslike/ARPG/Roguelike (partially inspired by Binding of Isaac; hence the name)

DDD (fists) does damage based on velocity
BottomlessChickenPouch does 20
CursedFish does 40
VibratingSharkTooth does 10 per 0.1s
ShootyThingamabob does 101 per shot

First boss is Boris
First optional boss is Fish
Second boss is Sharkteeth
Second optional boss is Gunshot
Last boss was supposed to be this like epic Touhou-like fight with cool music and phases and stuff...
...no last boss...

Items have descriptions in their respective rooms

No GUI for immersiveness and to encourage intuitive design more

Many missing sfx and stuff

Was going to have a roguelite-esque reset portal / NG+ portal
(Upgrade altar was going to support held items as well, for Demon's Curse)

...might come back to this idea in the future, but as another game...
